That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.At 12:40, I meant to say 20% above their capacityIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.At 12:40, I meant to say 20% above their capacityIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
